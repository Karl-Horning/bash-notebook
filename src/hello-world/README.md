## 🤓 Introduction

A minimalist Bash script that prints "hello world" to the terminal.
Because every journey starts with a single echo.

---

## 📌 What It Does

This script does exactly one thing:

```bash
echo hello world
```

That’s it. Nothing more. Nothing less.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Make it executable

```bash
chmod +x hello-world.sh
```

### 2. Run it

```bash
./hello-world.sh
```

### Output

```text
hello world
```

## 🧪 Why This Exists

This is the traditional starting point for anyone learning Bash (or any language, really).
It proves:

- Your script can run
- Your permissions are set correctly
- Your terminal is alive
- The world has, in fact, been greeted

---

## 🪜 Next Steps

Once you’ve mastered `echo`, you might want to explore:

- Variables (`name="World"`)
- Arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.)
- Conditional logic (`if`, `then`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions

But for now, you’ve conquered the hardest step: starting.

## 🧡 Author’s Note

This script may be small, but it's mighty in spirit.
