## Introduction

A Bash script to flatten the contents of **nested subdirectories** within each **immediate subfolder** of a specified directory. Files are moved up one level, and empty directories are removed, but the top-level folder structure is preserved.

---

## What It Does

Given a target directory (default: `/Users/$USER/flattenFolders`), this script:

1. Iterates over each **immediate subfolder**.
2. Moves any files from that subfolder’s nested directories up into the subfolder itself.
3. Deletes any empty directories left behind.

This is useful when you have folders like this:

```text
flattenFolders/
├── ProjectA/
│   └── subfolder1/
│       └── file1.txt
├── ProjectB/
│   └── file2.txt
```

After running the script:

```text
flattenFolders/
├── ProjectA/
│   └── file1.txt
├── ProjectB/
│   └── file2.txt
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Set the directory to flatten

The default directory is:

```bash
/Users/$USER/flattenFolders
```

To change this, edit the following line in the script:

```bash
dir_to_flatten="/Users/$USER/flattenFolders"
```

### 2. Make the script executable

```bash
chmod +x flatten-subfolders
```

### 3. Run the script

```bash
./flatten-subfolders
```

---

## Notes & Tips

- Files are moved using `mv -i`, which prompts before overwriting if a file with the same name exists.
- Make sure to back up any important files in case of accidental overwrites.
- The script **does not** delete files — only moves them and deletes **empty** folders.

---

## Example Folder Structure

Before:

```text
flattenFolders/
└── MyProject/
    ├── notes/
    │   └── todo.txt
    └── drafts/
        └── draft1.md
```

After:

```text
flattenFolders/
└── MyProject/
    ├── todo.txt
    └── draft1.md
```
